# FRIBSummerProject2023
FRIB TA Summer School Final Project

Branch author: Alexandra Semposki

Welcome to squirrel's branch! Here squirrel will be implementing the optimization routines from Morten Hjorth-Jensen's presentation during the 2023 FRIB-TA Summer School on the anharmonic oscillator. Squirrel is hoping to accomplish coding the Bayesian Ridge Regression or Lasso Regression for this problem.
